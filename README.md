## üîß Deployment Overview

### Quick Start with Docker Compose

The OpenBAS stack is modular and uses multiple Docker Compose files for easier configuration:

To start OpenBAS with the essential services, run:
```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

To start OpenBAS with the Caldera executor (Caldera used as an agent), run:
```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.caldera.yml -f docker-compose.caldera-executor.yml up -d
```

To start OpenBAS with the Caldera injector (Caldera used as an implant), run:
```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.caldera.yml -f docker-compose.caldera-injector.yml up -d
```
